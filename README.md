# CSS Flag(INDIA) Project

This is a simple HTML and CSS project that creates the flag of India using CSS styling. The flag is rendered using various div elements and CSS classes.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Create an HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) and copy the code provided into the file.
2. Create a CSS file (e.g., `flag.css`) and link it to the HTML file by adding the following line within the `<head>` section of the HTML file:

   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="flag.css">
   ```

3. Save the CSS code in the `flag.css` file.
4. Open the HTML file in a web browser to see the flag of India displayed on the page.

## Flag Structure

The flag is created using nested div elements with different CSS classes. Here's a breakdown of the structure:

- The outermost div with the class "all" contains the entire flag.
- The "flag" div represents the main body of the flag and is divided into three sections: orange, white, and green.
- The "orange" div represents the topmost section of the flag and has the color orange.
- The "white" div represents the middle section of the flag and has a white background. It contains nested div elements that create the circular shape and the Ashoka Chakra (wheel) in the center.
- The "green" div represents the bottom section of the flag and has the color green.

The Ashoka Chakra (wheel) is created using multiple div elements with different CSS classes. The spokes of the wheel are represented by the "spoke1" to "spoke24" divs, and the small circles within the wheel are represented by the "small-circle1" to "small-circle24" divs. The dots within the small circles are represented by the "dot" divs.

## Customization

You can customize the flag by modifying the CSS styles in the `flag.css` file. You can change colors, adjust sizes, or add additional elements as per your requirements.
